A wordpress starter skeleton for shared hosting enviroments using Composer. This is an attempt to mimic as much as possible from the excellent [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock) but deployable on a shared hosting server.

# Setup

Make sure you have `Composer` installed.

1. Clone the Repository
2. Run `composer install`

I've just started working on this. Has not been completely battle tested yet.

This is an amalgamation of the fine work done by:
[Composer Wordpress Skeleteon](https://github.com/ADARTA/Composer-Wordpress-Skeleton)
[Smashing Wordpress Composer](https://github.com/getdave/smashingmag-wordpress-composer)
[Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)
